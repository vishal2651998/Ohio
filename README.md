# CI/CD Solution Architecture

We will be proceeding with the following architecture for the CI/CD for an Angular application.

![CICD%Architecture%Diagram.jpg](documentation_resources/CICD%20Architecture%20Diagram.jpg)

# Steps

## Repository

Setup the repository to manage credentials for automatic deployment.

[Angular](https://angular.io/guide/build)

### environment.prod.ts

This is to be created to isolate production and local code development.

```tsx
export const environment = {
  production: true,
  APIUrl: "", // To be replaced by deployment instance
};
```

### .gitignore

This will include the typical angular project .gitignore.

[](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/.gitignore)

```
.DS_STORE

/dist/
/bazel-out
/integration/bazel/bazel-*
*.log
/node_modules/

# CircleCI temporary file for cache key computation.
# See `save_month_to_file` in `.circleci/config.yml`.

```

## EC2 Instance

### **************************Create an EC2 Instance**************************

Things to consider:

1. Operating System: Ubuntu-jammy-22.04 
2. Elastic IP address needs to be assigned

### Update Apt Repository

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

### Install Code-Deploy Agent

[Install the CodeDeploy agent for Ubuntu Server - AWS CodeDeploy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/codedeploy-agent-operations-install-ubuntu.html)

```bash
sudo apt install ruby-full
sudo apt install wget
cd /home/ubuntu
wget https://bucket-name.s3.region-identifier.amazonaws.com/latest/install
chmod +x ./install
sudo ./install auto
sudo service codedeploy-agent start
sudo service codedeploy-agent status
```

### Install nginx

```bash
sudo apt install nginx
```

### Configure Code Deploy Service IAM role for EC2

Create a User policy and assign the following AWS managed policy to it. Then attach it to EC2. 

IAM: **AmazonEC2RoleforAWSCodeDeploy**

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:GetObjectVersion",
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Tag EC2 Instance

It is necessary for Code deploy application deployment group to recognize the instance.

Key: Name

Value: ****unique****-*****name-for-ec2*****

## Code Build

This step is necessary to generate the artifacts of `ng build` of the frontend application. Create a code Build Project from the Code Build in AWS Console.

### Project Configuration

![Untitled](documentation_resources/Untitled.png)

Give a project name. Optionally Build Badge can be turned on.

### Source

![Untitled](documentation_resources/Untitled%201.png)

Put GitHub Enterprise as the source provider. Configure the GitHub Enterprise personal access token from your enterprise GitHub Developer settings tab. Be sure to provide Repo Full access to the PAT and set the expiration likewise. Provide the 

![Untitled](documentation_resources/Untitled%202.png)

![Untitled](documentation_resources/Untitled%203.png)

Once the personal token is saved in the code build. Put the Repository URL.

![Untitled](documentation_resources/Untitled%204.png)

### Primary source webhook events

This can be left unchecked. AWS Code Pipeline will take care of that.

![Untitled](documentation_resources/Untitled%205.png)

### Environment

This is important consideration since it looks at the codebuild script: buildspec.yml in your source code. To ensure that your build environment will not fail refer to the codebuild environment Docker images for testing.

[Docker images provided by CodeBuild - AWS CodeBuild](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-env-ref-available.html)

The following could be an instance of one configuration.

![Untitled](documentation_resources/Untitled%206.png)

To configure the role for AWS CodeBuild let the CodeBuild create one or refer to the following documentation for creating one. Easier option is to let CodeBuild take care of it.

[AWS CodeBuild permissions reference - AWS CodeBuild](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/auth-and-access-control-permissions-reference.html)

### Buildspec

![Untitled](documentation_resources/Untitled%207.png)

Place the buildspec.yml configuration file into root of the project. The typical file will look like this for angular project.

```yaml
version: 0.2
phases:
    install:
      runtime-versions:
        nodejs: 18
    pre_build:
      commands:
          - echo Installing source NPM dependencies...
          - npm install --force
          - npm install -g @angular/cli
    build:
        commands:
            - echo Build started on `date`
            - ng build --configuration=production
    post_build:
         commands:
            - echo Build completed on `date`
artifacts:
    files:
        - 'dist/**/*'
        - appspec.yml
        - 'scripts/**'
        - nginx.conf
```

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Note: nginx.conf has been included in the source repository to manage nginx configuration as a part of deployment. Additionally, scripts directory and appspec.yml are requirements for AWS CodeDeploy for the deployment configuration.

</aside>

For reference:

[Build specification reference for CodeBuild - AWS CodeBuild](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html)

---

### Artifacts

This is where you usually define where to store the generated artifacts from build into. However, since this code build will be used in conjunction with AWS CodePipeline, it will be managed by CodePipeline. We can leave it to No artifacts right now.

![Untitled](documentation_resources/Untitled%208.png)

### Logs

Additionally, Logging can be turned on to get information on CodeBuild. However, if you are sure that the script works or alternatively, we can verify it from the AWS CodePipeline console for Code Build errors. This can be left unchecked.

![Untitled](documentation_resources/Untitled%209.png)

## Code Deploy

It manages the deployment of artifacts into the EC2 instance. Make sure to do code-deploy agent installation first in EC2 instance. From the AWS Code Deploy Console proceed with create application.

### Create Application

Give an application name and select a compute platform to deploy the code. For this case: EC2/On-premises.

![Untitled](documentation_resources/Untitled%2010.png)

### Deployment groups

Select the currently created application. and select the Deployment groups tab. Then proceed with the Create Deployment group.

### Deployment groups: Deployment group name

![Untitled](documentation_resources/Untitled%2011.png)

Give a unique deployment group name.

### Deployment groups: Service role

![Untitled](documentation_resources/Untitled%2012.png)

Create a service role for the AWS Code Deploy. For this create a role in AWS IAM console and Attach the following AWS managed Role:

AWSCodeDeployRole

The policy should be like this:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "autoscaling:CompleteLifecycleAction",

                "autoscaling:DescribeLifecycleHooks",
                "autoscaling:PutLifecycleHook",
                "autoscaling:RecordLifecycleActionHeartbeat",
                "autoscaling:CreateAutoScalingGroup",
                "autoscaling:CreateOrUpdateTags",
                "autoscaling:UpdateAutoScalingGroup",
                "autoscaling:EnableMetricsCollection",
                "autoscaling:DescribePolicies",
                "autoscaling:DescribeScheduledActions",
                "autoscaling:DescribeNotificationConfigurations",
                "autoscaling:SuspendProcesses",
                "autoscaling:ResumeProcesses",
                "autoscaling:AttachLoadBalancers",
                "autoscaling:AttachLoadBalancerTargetGroups",
                "autoscaling:PutScalingPolicy",
                "autoscaling:PutScheduledUpdateGroupAction",
                "autoscaling:PutNotificationConfiguration",
                "autoscaling:PutWarmPool",
                "autoscaling:DescribeScalingActivities",
                "autoscaling:DeleteAutoScalingGroup",
                "ec2:DescribeInstances",
                "ec2:DescribeInstanceStatus",
                "ec2:TerminateInstances",
                "tag:GetResources",
                "sns:Publish",
                "cloudwatch:DescribeAlarms",
                "cloudwatch:PutMetricAlarm",
                "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeLoadBalancers",
                "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeInstanceHealth",
                "elasticloadbalancing:RegisterInstancesWithLoadBalancer",
                "elasticloadbalancing:DeregisterInstancesFromLoadBalancer",
                "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeTargetGroups",
                "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeTargetHealth",
                "elasticloadbalancing:RegisterTargets",
                "elasticloadbalancing:DeregisterTargets"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Deployment groups: Deployment type

According to your preference select the deployment strategy. Usually this depends on the requirement of application.

![Untitled](documentation_resources/Untitled%2013.png)

### Deployment groups: Environment configuration

This depends on the solution architecture if you have multiple instance configuration for redundancy purpose. For a single instance deployment select ********************Amazon EC2 instance******************** and select the appropriate tag you created while setting up your instance.

![Untitled](documentation_resources/Untitled%2014.png)

### Deployment groups: Agent Configuration with AWS Systems Manager

AWS Systems Manager is wonderful tool in managing SysOps work. It can be used to automate installation of code deploy agent in the EC2 instance also. However, for ease of setup, we have manually installed the code deploy agent for more control vectors. So you can proceed with the following option. 

![Untitled](documentation_resources/Untitled%2015.png)

### Deployment groups: Deployment Configuration

We can opt with the one shown below. However, this can be tweaked with your own project requirements usually in the case of Auto Scaling Groups. 

![Untitled](documentation_resources/Untitled%2016.png)

### Deployment groups: Load Balancer

If you have implemented the load balancer in your solution, select an appropriate target group. However, in case of single instance uncheck the Enable load balancing option.

![Untitled](documentation_resources/Untitled%2017.png)

### Deployment groups: Advanced - optional

Additional settings can be configured to enhance the deployment. Following are additional features that can be enabled with Deployment groups. You can then proceed with Create deployment group option.

![Untitled](documentation_resources/Untitled%2018.png)

## AWS CodePipeline

AWS CodePipeline helps us to create end to end CI/CD and DevOps cycle for the project. It can integrate the following phases of DevOps Cycle:

![Untitled](documentation_resources/Untitled%2019.png)

Proceed with the Create Pipeline option from the AWS CodePipeline Console.

### Pipeline settings

Give pipeline a unique name. You can let pipeline create a service role for your project which is an easier option. For reference the following is the Service Role for the AWS CodePipeline.

```json
